'Learn to Code for Data Analysis' was a free MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) created by the Open University and hosted on FutureLearn, a UK-based social learning platform up until 2018.

Over 4 weeks, this hands-on course introduced the use of:

* Python 3 and the pandas data analysis module
* the Jupyter Notebook application
* SageMathCloud, later renamed CoCalc (an online Jupyter notebook resource)
* the Anaconda IDE (used for offline work)

This repo contains the four project notebooks produced during the course, as outlined below. 

Project 1: Deaths by tuberculosis
In Project 1, learners applied the basic data techniques and principles learned in Week 1 to TB population and death rate data sourced from the World Health Organisation. The project 1 notebook, Week_1_project.ipynb, is accessible on Colaboratory here:

Project 2: Holiday weather - Chester, UK
In Project 2, learners applied what they had learned so far to historic weather data sourced from Weather Underground. The project 2 notebook, Week_2_project_Chester_UK.ipynb, is accessible on Colaboratory here:
